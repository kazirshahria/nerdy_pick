# Nerdy Picks - NFL & NBA ðŸ¤“

The intersection of sports, machine learning, and technology. The long-term goal is to achieve a system that predicts with high accuracy of moneyline, athlete prop, and more.

I am well aware of the randomness involved for building such a model that can predict the events mentioned. For example, there isn't a statistical metric that can tell how a team or athlete feels, their distress levels, and other metrics that may impact performance. Even if these metrics were known, it is impossible to predict if an athlete gets hurt or the Boston Celtics being blown out by 50 points in the first half. To summarize, there's external factors which makes this project interesting and difficult to model.

The first concept of this project will be targeted towards NFL and NBA fans. The tech stack that will be (and are already being) used are listed below.

Currently working on this massive project by myself and I would perfer to keep it that way. But, if you'd like to learn more on what's being built or have information to share, feel free to contact me using the links below.
